Assignment 1: Use neural network concept to solve for the weights of linear regression.

Assignment 2: Use SVM to process CIFAR-10 dataset.

Assignment 3: Use neural network concept to solve logistic regression weights

Assignment 4: Construct a neural network model for classification and regression model

Assignment 5: Use Iris dataset to validate decision tree and further derive tree diagram, and usek-mean to see the variable prediction power by Iris dataset.
